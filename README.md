# QLab  
🔗 [Visit the official site](https://qsyntaxchannel.com/qlab/)

**QLab** is a growing collection of modular Qlik Sense script files designed to simplify and accelerate your development workflow. Each script acts as a standalone utility or library, ready to be reused, extended, or embedded into your own Qlik projects.

> Think of it as your personal lab for experimenting, learning, and scaling reusable logic in Qlik Sense.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository contains a specific script or set of functions with its own purpose. All scripts are independent by design — no dependencies between them unless explicitly mentioned.

- [Set/](./Set) — utility script for centralizing variable declarations
